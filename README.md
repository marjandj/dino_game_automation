This project is a simple Python bot that plays the offline Chrome Dino game autonomously using PyAutoGUI for pixel detection and keyboard control. It analyzes a small area in front of the dinosaur character, checking for obstacles on the ground (cacti) or in the air (birds) by evaluating pixel brightness. When a dark object is detected, the script triggers a jump or duck action accordingly.
